# picofeed

> Microscopic Secure Feed occupying a single buffer

This is a tiny ultra-portable secure feed, it's designed be small enough to be easily
embedded and replicated, for example it can be hidden inside a URL or nested within other
secure feeds as a means to transfer information cross-medium securely.

- URLs can be stored on most platforms and channels
- [No network code](https://xkcd.com/2259/)
- Browser support via Browserify / node-globals (requires Buffer shim)
- Singular dependency: sodium-universal

```
npm install picofeed
```

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

Sorry most of the API is currently undocumented (read the source),
feel free to poke me a bout it!

```js
const Pico = require('picofeed')

const alice = Pico.signPair() // generate a sodium sign_pair
const bob = Pico.signPair()

const feed = new Pico()

feed.append('Hello', alice.sk) // => 1
feed.get(0) // => 'Hello'

const url = 'http://myapp.tld/#' + feed.pickle()

// share the url

const remoteFeed = Pico.from(url)
remoteFeed.get(0) // => 'Hello'

// Attach a block to feed
remoteFeed.append('Hey alice!', bob.sk)

// share second URL containing 2 blocks from 2 different identities.
const url2 = 'http://myapp.tld/#' + remoteFeed.pickle()

feed.merge(url2) // => 1
feed.get(1) // => 'Hey alice'
```

## Sparse feeds (slice merge)

`Feed#slice(n)` has been added `in 2.1.x` allowing you
to distribute and merge individual blocks.

```js
const { sk } = Pico.signPair()
const X = new Pico()

X.append('Alpha', sk)
X.append('Bravo', sk)
// X now contains ['Alpha', 'Bravo']

const Y = X.slice(1) // Y contains ['Bravo']

X.append('Charlie', sk) // ['Alpha', 'Bravo', 'Charlie']

const Z = X.slice(2) // Z contains ['Charlie']

X.truncate(1) // X becomes ['Alpha']

// Merge fails can't connect Alpha to Charlie
X.merge(Z) // => false

// Disconnected slice-merge
Z.merge(Y) // => true; Z now contains ['Bravo', 'Charlie']

// Merge with Z now succeeds, X reproduced to full length.
X.merge(Z) // => true; X contains ['Alpha', 'Bravo', 'Charlie']
```
